                  Since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, I have been trying to improve myself in the fields of
                  WEB Development and WEB Security. As a result of the information I have learned, I have my own website
                  among the first projects I have put out publicly.Dec. The site you are currently browsing was designed
                  from scratch, written in ReactJS and powered by TailwindCSS and PicoCSS.

                  SRET is a community founded by me and my friends during the pandemic. We designed our own website
                  using a ready-made template. I learned using templates, advanced CSS animations and use some APIâ€™s.

                  Yavuzlar is a WEB security team established under the SiberVatan project. The first cyber security
                  tool that we developed as all members of Yavuzlar was a scraper and it is working on CLI. This scraper
                  developed with GoLang and it is not publicly accessible.

                  Another project that we developed as all members of the Yavuzlar WEB security team was the WEB Fuzzing

                  Todo Application and Personal Website Tryings I made while learning ReactJS, Movie Poster Page,
                  Translation Application, Exchange Rates Application and GitHub Profile Page application I made while
